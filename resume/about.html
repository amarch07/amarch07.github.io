<h2> SUMMARY </h2>
  <p> My name is Alison Moses and I am intrigued by technology. I am currently teaching myself how to code and hoping to break into the exciting world of technology soon.</p>
  <p>I am a professional who learns by doing. Effectively communicating and establishing relationships with others is my strong suit. I have extensive experience working on collaborative teams and taking a multidisplinary approach to solving problems. I am a quick learner- I have been learning to code and recently completed Udacity's Introduction to Programming certificate course- with no prior knowlege or experience.</p>
  <p>Currently I work in the healthcare and education sector as a physical therapist. My job is to provide care to children with disabilities and developmental delays, educate caregivers and families, and advocate for their rights and needs. </p>
  <p>What do I love most about my job? When I help kids achieve those light-bulb moments when they learn something new- like, how to pull to stand to knock off every DVD their parents have neatly stacked in alphabetical order on the shelf. I help parents help their children through coaching, modeling, and often simply listening to what matters most to them.</p>
